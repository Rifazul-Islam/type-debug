                <h1> 01. Localstorage and sessionstorage difference ..? </h1>
                <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                    expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded
                    in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                    particular tab. </p>

                <h1> 02.What do global scope and block scope difference..? </h1>
                <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
                    controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like. </p>

                <h1> 03.How do event loop work in javascript...? </h1>
                <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                    collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                    models in other languages like C and Java. </p>
